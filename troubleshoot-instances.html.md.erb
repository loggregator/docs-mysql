This topic provides techniques that app developers can use to begin troubleshooting
 on-demand instances.

## <a id="errors"></a> Troubleshoot Errors

Start here if you are responding to a specific error or error messages.

### <a id="x-product"></a> Common Service Errors

Errors common to on-demand services are:

+ [No Metrics from Log Cache](#no-metrics)

+ [When Using Service-Gateway Access, create-service or update-service Fails](#no-service-gateway-ports)

<%# The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials %>

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/troubleshoot-template", locals: {
	id: 'no-metrics',
    description: 'No Metrics from Log Cache',
    symptom: 'You receive no metrics when running the <code>cf tail</code> command.',
    cause: 'This might be because the Firehose is disabled in the ' +  vars.app_runtime_abbr + ' tile.',
    solution: 'Ask your operator to ensure that the <strong>V2 Firehose</strong> checkbox is enabled,
    and the <strong>Enable Log Cache syslog ingestion</strong> checkbox is disabled in the ' +
	vars.app_runtime_abbr + ' tile.
    For more information about configuring these checkboxes, see
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/logging-config-opsman.html#syslog-forward">Enable Syslog Forwarding</a>.'

    symptom: "<p>When you run <code>cf create-service</code> or <code>cf update-service</code> with

            <p>If all the ports in the range have been assigned to other service instances,
            then you cannot create or update service instances to use service-gateway access.</p>",
    solution: "<p>To resolve this error, confirm that the problem is due to not enough ports

### <a id="inaccessible"></a>If Instances or Database are Inaccessible

- ["500" Error during Backup or Restore](#failed-adbr-500)

### <a id="disk-usage-increases"></a> Persistent Disk Usage Is Increasing

If you have set the `optimize_for_short_words` parameter to `true` and
you are alerted that persistent disk usage is high,
then you might need to optimize indexed tables.

    symptom: '<p>You have set the <code>optimize_for_short_words</code> optional parameter to <code>true</code>
    and the persistent disk is filling up.
      </p>
      For information about the parameter,
      see <a href="change-default.html#optimize_for_short_words">Optimize for Short Words</a>.',
    cause: 'Over time, data has been deleted from your database and
            the full-text index has become too large.',
    solution: 'Remove full-text entries for deleted or old records by following the instructions
               in <a href="change-default.html#optimize_for_short_words">Optimize for Short Words</a>.'

## <a id="techniques"></a> Techniques for Troubleshooting

See the following sections for troubleshooting techniques when using
the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic
operations on a <%= vars.product_short %> service instance.

Basic cf CLI operations include `create`, `update`, `bind`, `unbind`, and `delete`.


### <a id="parse-error"></a>Understand a Cloud Foundry (CF) Error Message

<!-- The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials -->

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/partials/services-tshoot/tshoot-tech-parse-error' %>

### <a id="instance"></a> Find Information about Your Service Instance

You might need to find the name, GUID, or other information about a service instance.
To find this information, do the following:

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space.
The service instances are listed in the `name` column.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql      db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. To retrieve more information about a specific instance, run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`

1. To retrieve the GUID of the instance, run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid`

   The GUID is useful for debugging.
